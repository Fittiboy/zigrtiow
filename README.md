# [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/)
But in Zig!

# Book 1
## 2. Output an Image
Translating the first bit of code from the book into Zig, we have created
our first image!

## 4. Rays, a Simple Camera, and Background
After some more Stuffâ„¢ was written, there are now rays and colors and
viewports and cameras!  
It's a lot more impressive behind the scenes than the produced image
lets on!

## 5. Adding a Sphere
I'm now able to add spheres to my scene! Following the book, I was able to
produce a simple image of a red sphere on my gradient.

### Bonus
Before moving on to the next chapter, I wanted to add some depth to the very
flat sphere, so I decided to darken it based on the distance to the camera.

After that, I wanted to have some more color, so I tried turning the
collision normal into a color.  
First, I used the absolute value:  

![A blue sphere with green and purple edges](samples/pngs/sphere_normal_abs_color.png)  

Then I added (1, 1, 1) to the normal and divided it by 2:

I also tried just norming the vector again after shifting it, but I like
the previous one better than this:

### Bonus Bonus
Couldn't resist and wanted to see if I could add a naive light source. I could.
